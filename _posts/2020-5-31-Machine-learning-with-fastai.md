*In which we complete homework number 1 of the fast.ai course: building a classifier*

I started following the fast.ai course motivated by the fun of doing it with a friend and also wanting to build cool things. I'm only at the very beginning but what I like so far is the focus on the practical - make it work and then understand why. As someone who often gets bogged down with details, this is a great learning style to keep me progressing. I also really like the "show and tell" segments of the videos which showcase cool things that other people have built. The implementations range from the novel and imaginative to the humourous.
