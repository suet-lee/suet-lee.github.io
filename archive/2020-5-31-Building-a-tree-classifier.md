*In which we building a classifier for the most common trees in the UK.*

I started following the fast.ai course motivated by the fun of doing it with a friend and also wanting to build cool things. I'm only at the very beginning but what I like so far is the focus on the practical - make it work and then understand why. As someone who often gets bogged down with details, this is a great learning style to keep me progressing. I also really like the "show and tell" segments of the videos which showcase cool things that other people have built.
